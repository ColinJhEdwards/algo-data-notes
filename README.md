A simple repo where I can store my notes on algorithms, data structures, examples and bigO notation

## Big O Notation

### Why is big O notation important?

-There are so many solutions for solving an algorithm, how do we know which one is the best? This is where Big O comes in.
-Take for example given the problem "write a function that accepts a string input and returns a reversed copy" you could use a variety of solutions for this, we would we use Big O notation to understand which is the best
-Keep in mind that the way Big O ranks how well a solution performs is not as straight forwrd as "worst - best" its more of a numeric approach.
-You may ask, why worry about the best solution if my code works?
-Its important to have precise vocabulary to talk about how our code performs.
-Useful for discussing trade offs between different approaches.
-Help understand what parts of our code that could be slowing it down.

### Example

-Write a function that calculates the sum of all number from 1 up to n
